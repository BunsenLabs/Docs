# NAME

bl-alternatives - update-alternatives(8) configuration for BunsenLabs

# DESCRIPTION

The "Bunsen Alternatives" are four groups added to the Debian
alternatives system:

    bl-file-manager
    bl-text-editor
    bl-image-viewer
    bl-media-player

They can be used in menus, keyboard shortcuts, config files and scripts
just like any other command, and will call up whatever application has
been set as that alternative. Often the setting will be done
automatically, but even done manually it only needs to be done once to
cover all the calls to that command. (See *EDITING ALTERNATIVES* below.)

The default settings in a new install of BunsenLabs are:

`bl-file-manager`
:   Thunar

`bl-text-editor`
:   Geany or Leafpad

`bl-image-viewer`
:   Mirage

`bl-media-player`
:   VLC

The only difference from the other Debian alternatives is that they are
not automatically added by packages themselves.  For example, when
xfce4-terminal is installed, it will add itself to the available options
for x-terminal-emulator. However, even though pcmanfm is a possible
alternative for bl-file-manager the pcmanfm package will not add
itself to that alternatives group. That job is done by the
bl-alternatives script which is called automatically by dpkg after
each package install.  (It is very fast and does not significantly
slow down the install.)

The applications which can be added by bl-alternatives are:

`bl-file-manager`
:   thunar pcmanfm spacefm nautilus

`bl-text-editor`
:   geany emacs gedit jedit kate leafpad mousepad scite

`bl-image-viewer`
:   mirage eog eom viewnior

`bl-media-player`
:   vlc banshee dragonplayer gnome-mplayer kaffeine parole smplayer totem

You can change these by editing */usr/bin/bl-alternatives*, or add an
app to an alternative group manually (see below).

# EDITING ALTERNATIVES

You can edit any Debian Alternatives (including the **bl-\*** BunsenLabs
varieties) with the command **update-alternatives**(8) but there is also a
graphic front end called `Galternatives` which is easier to use in some
ways.

In the BunsenLabs menu, click *"System" > "Edit Debian Alternatives"*.
You can scroll down the list to see what alternative groups have been
installed on your system, what options are available for each group and
if there is more than one option you can set a different one.

You can also add a new application to an existing alternative group, so
if the **bl-alternatives** script has failed to add your favourite image
viewer to **bl-image-viewer** you can add it manually here.

It is not possible to remove a whole group with galternatives, but you
can remove an individual option from some group.

These settings are system-wide, affecting all users.  

## PER-USER CHANGES

If you want a local version of bl-file-manager set to eg spacefm, while
leaving the system setting unchanged, then put a symbolic link called
**bl-file-manager** in *~/bin* which points to */usr/bin/spacefm*.  If
*~/bin* is in your `$PATH` and comes before */usr/bin* then your symlink
will override the system **bl-file-manager**.
