BunsenLabs Autostart
===================

The X session and BunsenLabs session
====================================

When you log in to an X session, a "session manager" is chosen from the
.desktop files in /usr/share/xsessions to start a window manager and other processes needed.
With simple systems like BunsenLabs it's usual to have a user "autostart" file to run
things like desktop panels and utilities.

The BL session manager 'bunsenlabs-session' runs a window manager (openbox by default),
sets openbox to use ~/.config/openbox/bl-rc.xml as its config file,
and runs the user autostart file ~/.config/bunsen/autostart.

The BunsenLabs autostart file
=============================

~/.config/bunsen/autostart

This script is run after the window manager has started up.

All lines are treated as normal shell commands and can be
changed by users to set up their desktop session as they want.

The comments should help, but note:

1) This will be run by the default shell 'sh' which in Debian is dash, not bash,
so only basic shell commands will work.

2) Commands which start long-running processes should be "forked" with an ampersand
or else the autostart script will stop at that line till the process ends, eg:
pnmixer &
Commands which return quickly do not need this, eg:
xset b off

3) There is a section in the middle where certain lines only apply for a particular window manager.
The openbox section is complete, but the XFCE and Awesome Window Manager clauses
are just suggestions. If you want to use a different window manager, change the
window_manager=openbox
line near the top of the file to whatever you want to use, eg
window_manager=awesome
(Use the actual command which launches the window manager, not its name, if different.)
Then make a new clause in the 'case $window_manager in...' section to call the apps you will need.

4) Many applications use the xdg autostart mechanism based on
.desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart.

The last line in the BunsenLabs autostart file:
bl-xdg-autostart
will start up the appropriate .desktop files for you.
If you would prefer to ignore the xdg autostart and start all applications manually,
comment out that line and add the necessary commands to your autostart file instead.

NOTE: Openbox and desktop environments like Gnome or XFCE will also invoke the same xdg autostart.
